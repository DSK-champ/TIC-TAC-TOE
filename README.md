# TIC-TAC-TOE
Just a fun game i created

This project was inspired by an unexpected but eye-opening moment during a class. My professor briefly introduced the Minimax algorithm, even though it wasn't part of our official syllabus. That small detour sparked a big idea in me.

I had already built a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game, but the thought of playing against an AI â€” and making that AI smart â€” really fascinated me. So I got to work. After a few weeks of experimenting, debugging, and learning how Minimax works, I finally created this version: a single-player Tic Tac Toe game where you play against a Minimax-powered AI opponent.
